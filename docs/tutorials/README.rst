This is the area for JuliaFEM.jl notebook development
-----------------------------------------------------

We use notebooks heavily to test our ideas and develop new code. Code in these
notebooks most likely will not up to date code: *DO NOT COPYPASTE* code
from here unless you really do know what you are doing. These notebooks are not
tested automatically.

Our "official" notebooks are in verification and in tutorials:
