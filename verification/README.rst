Definition of the verification vs validation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation

This is the area for JuliaFEM.jl verification cases
---------------------------------------------------

Currently the idea is to create a folder for each individual verification case. Then we will create a function which will parse this folder structure to www.juliafem.org documentation. Also Jupyter notebooks format should be used for JuliaFEM part and please remember add the reference to the origing of the verification case. Also data files / correct results would be nice to store in the case folder.
